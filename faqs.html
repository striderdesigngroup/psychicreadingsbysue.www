                    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Q: What is the difference between a Tarot Reading and a Psychic/Spiritual/Intuitive Reading?</h2>
                    <p>A Tarot Reading is done using a deck of Tarot cards whereas a psychic reading uses intuition to access the spiritual world. Some aspects of a psychic reading include knowing (claircognizance), seeing (clairvoyance), hearing (clairaudience), and feeling (clairsentience) the information my Spirit Guides want me to share with you.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Q: What is claircognizance?</h2>
                    <p>Claircognizance, in its most basic definition, means clear-knowing. It is the ability for a person to acquire information by just knowing it. The information comes through intrinsic knowledge, as in it just "comes to mind."</p>
                    
                    <h2>Q: What is clairvoyance?</h2>
                    <p>Clairvoyance, or clear-vision, is the ability to gain information about an object, person, location or physical event through "seeing" a vision in the mind's eye.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Q: What is clairaudience?</h2>
                    <p>Clairaudience is the receiving of messages in thought form, usually from another frequency or realm and is considered a form of channeling. This is not unlike listening to that little voice in the back of your head.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Q: What is clairsentience?</h2>
                    <p>Clairsentience is clear-feeling, or the ability to read strong feelings (like gut feelngs) to gain knowledge from other realms. Often, a clairsentient psychic will be able to feel subconscious energy. This includes sensing danger, feeling spirits and entities when they are present, sensing when something is about to happen or sensing when there is strong positive or negative energy about someone.</p>
                    
                     <h2>Q: How long have you been intuitive?</h2>
                     <p>I have been intuitive all my life. Since childhood I have always just known.</p>
                    
                     <h2>Q: How long have you been reading people professionally?</h2>
                     <p>I have been doing this professionally for over a decade working with the Mind, Body, Spirit Expo that travels the country as well as with people around the area in which I live.</p>
                   
                    <h2>Q: Can you combine a Psychic/Spiritual/Intuitive Reading with a tarot reading?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, these can be combined to perform a more thorough reading.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Q: Do I need to come to you to have my reading?</h2>
                    <p>Not at all! You can reach me by just calling me from the comfort of your own home. So make yourself comfortable and get ready for the reading of your life.</p>
