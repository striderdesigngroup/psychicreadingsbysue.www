                    <p>"Let me just say that Sue Parry is the real deal! I was going nowhere in my screenwriting career until I meet her for a reading. She said there would be a major change coming in my career, and was she right! She nudged me to go forward with my writing, and a couple of months after the reading I optioned not one, but two feature film scripts (within the span of one week). <br /><br />I highly recommended Sue for anyone who wants the most accurate reading anywhere. </p>
                    <!--
                    <p>"Sue has been nothing less than an angel in human form. I have to say that she is always honest and open and shows a level of compassion that is by far beyond what most would expect when getting a reading from her. Sue doesn't rush you through things and she's there for you as you wish for her to be. She also takes the time to listen and she does know where things are going but gives the most direct information you deserve. <br /><br />

                    <p>Sue doesn't dance around issues when she reads for you, she tells it to you as you need to hear it and while some may only want readings that are full of fields of flowers and bunnies hopping around, sue gives a touch of reality to let you know that she's real. The woman just has an immaculate heart that as a client I truly feel is in touch with the powers on high. She never steers you wrong and her accuracy is stunning. She even shows you things you didn't ask for and THIS is the one thing that lets you know she is really skilled. </p>

                    <p>Let's be honest if I can get a reading from someone who can describe people that I haven't even offered a description of right down to hairstyles and weight, height and what not THAT my friends is a skilled intuitive. I advise anyone who needs someone dependable and honest to work with Sue. She's wonderful...truly..and bless the universe that  she's here. This lady is awesome! Spend your money with Sue, she's worth every dollar!"</p>-->

                        The last reading I had from Sue was about a job I was applying for, wanting to know if I was going to get it. She told me I would have my choice. When I went to the interview, at the end he told me "You have your choice of what you want!" I just laughed to myself, word for word! She never fails to amaze me at how accurate she is!

After meeting with Sue, an intuitive feeling came over me and I knew she was authentic. The accuracy with what Sue read in my reading was phenomenal and gave me chill bumps! She is very gifted and she and I remain in touch. I will be calling on her again and again!"</p><p class="feed">&mdash; Deanna M. from Charlotte, NC</p>

                    <p>"I have had several readings with Sue, and her readings are astonishingly accurate. During one reading, she told me an ex was going to show back up in my life. The next day he was literally on my doorstep. Sue speaks to you like a very dear old friend. The advise she passes on is from the heart. Give her a try, you won't regret it."</p><p class="feed">&mdash; Debra H. from Fremont, NC</p>
